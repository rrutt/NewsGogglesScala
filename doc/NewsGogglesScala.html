<title>News Goggles - Rules Engine in Scala and Java</title>
</head>
<body>
<h3>The Setup</h3>
<p><b>News Goggles</b> is the name of an imaginary web site focused on daily news feeds. A proof-of-concept rules engine uses Scala and Java integration to apply <em>matchmaker</em> rules. These rules dispatch news feeds to readers based on their
personal preferences.</p>
<p>This demonstration rules engine uses <b>Scala</b>, which is a language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</p>
<p>A complete Scala integrated development environment (IDE), including Eclipse, is available here: <a target='_blank' href=
"http://typesafe.com/stack/downloads/scala-ide">http://typesafe.com/stack/downloads/scala-ide</a></p>
<p>The News Goggles demo implementation is in the public domain and is available for download from this GitHub repository:
<a target='_blank' href=
"https://github.com/rrutt/NewsGogglesScala.git">https://github.com/rrutt/NewsGogglesScala.git</a></p>
<p>To run the demo, open a command-prompt (terminal) window and
navigate to the <b>out</b> sub-folder, containing the JAR file.
Enter one of the following commands. The program will process
rules, display progress messages and results, and then exit.</p>
<pre>
  java -jar NewsGogglesScala.jar
  
  java -jar NewsGogglesScala.jar -test
</pre>

<h3>The Application</h3>
<p>Here are the business requirements for the News Goggles rules
engine:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Providers</em> publish <em>Articles</em>.</li>
<li><em>Subscribers</em> open the web site to review
Articles.</li>
<li>The Providers tag each Article with one or more
<em>Topics</em>.</li>
<li>Each Subscriber registers a set of <em>Subscription
Rules</em>:
<ul>
<li>A Subscriber can <b>Like</b> any number of Providers and/or
Topics.</li>
<li>A Subscriber can also <b>Dislike</b> any number of Providers
and/or Topics.</li>
<li><b>Dislike</b> rules override <b>Like</b> rules.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A Subscriber can also enter <em>Exception Rules</em> that
override their Subscription Rules:
<ul>
<li>A Subscriber can <b>Allow</b> a specific combination of
Provider covering a Topic.</li>
<li>A Subscriber can <b>Block</b> a specific combination of
Provider covering a Topic.</li>
<li><b>Block</b> rules override <b>Allow</b> rules.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Identifier conventions:</b> Except for Articles,
identifiers are quoted literals.
<ul>
<li>Articles are identified by arbitrary unique integers. The
content of each Article is a quote-delimited string.</li>
<li>Providers are identified with a <b>$</b> prefix. Examples:
<b>"$CNN" "$FOX" "$ESPN" "$CBC" "$NBC" "$Wired"
"$NYTimes"</b></li>
<li>Topics are identified with a <b>#</b> prefix. Examples:
<b>"#world" "#usa" "#sports" "#entertainment" "#business"
"#politics" "#opinion"</b></li>
<li>Subscribers are identified with an <b>@</b> prefix. Examples:
<b>"@Alice" "@Bob" "@Chris" "@Pat"</b></li></ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Let's see how our data model for storing the news feed data
and the preference rules looks in the original Prolog
notation:</p>
<pre>
/*
Data-base of published articles, designated as 
  <b>article(ArticleId, Provider, Contents).</b>
  <b>article_topic(ArticleId, Topic).</b>
*/

  article(1001, "$ESPN", "Tigers sign Prince Fielder.").
  article_topic(1001, "#sports").
  article_topic(1001, "#baseball").
  article_topic(1001, "#detroit").
  
  article(1002, "$ESPN", "Peyton Manning home team locker to be used by arch-nemesis Tom Brady?").
  article_topic(1002, "#sports").
  article_topic(1002, "#indianapolis").
  article_topic(1002, "#football").
  
  article(2001, "$FOX", "Newt nabs South Carolina.").
  article_topic(2001, "#politics").
  article_topic(2001, "#republicans").
  
  article(2002, "$FOX", "Do we need to go back to the moon?").
  article_topic(2002, "#usa").
  article_topic(2002, "#opinion").
  
  article(3001, "$CNN", "Obama visits Michigan.").
  article_topic(3001, "#politics").
  article_topic(3001, "#democrats").
  article_topic(3001, "#detroit").
  
  article(3002, "$CNN", "Obama urges congress to act in election year.").
  article_topic(3002, "#politics").
  article_topic(3002, "#democrats").
  article_topic(3002, "#washington").
  
  article(4001, "$MSNBC", "Mitt makes moves in Florida.").
  article_topic(4001, "#politics").
  article_topic(4001, "#republicans").
  
  article(4002, "$MSNBC", "Celebrities attending Super Bowl parties.").
  article_topic(4002, "#indianapolis").
  article_topic(4002, "#entertainment").

/*
Rule-base of Subscriber preferences, designated as:
  <b>subscriber_likes(Subscriber, ProviderOrTopic).</b>
  <b>subscriber_dislikes(Subscriber, ProviderOrTopic).</b>
  <b>subscriber_allows(Subscriber, Provider, Topic).</b>
  <b>subscriber_blocks(Subscriber, Provider, Topic).</b>
*/

  subscriber_likes("@Alice", "#politics").
  subscriber_likes("@Alice", "#sports").
  subscriber_likes("@Alice", "$CNN").
  subscriber_likes("@Alice", "$MSNBC").
  
  subscriber_likes("@Bob", "#politics").
  subscriber_likes("@Bob", "#detroit").
  subscriber_dislikes("@Bob", "#democrats").
  subscriber_dislikes("@Bob", "$CNN").
  subscriber_allows("@Bob", "$CNN", "#detroit").
  
  subscriber_likes("@Chris", "#politics").
  subscriber_dislikes("@Chris", "$FOX").
  
  subscriber_likes("@Pat", "$FOX").
  subscriber_likes("@Pat", "#sports").
  subscriber_likes("@Pat", "#republicans").
  subscriber_blocks("@Pat", "$FOX", "#opinion").  
</pre>

<p>The application parses these articles and preferences data
feeds and then determines which articles to send to each
subscriber.</p>
