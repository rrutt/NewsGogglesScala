News Goggles - Rules Engine in Scala and Java

  "News Goggles" is the name of an imaginary web site focused on daily
  news feeds. A proof-of-concept rules engine uses Scala and Java integration
  to apply matchmaker rules. These rules dispatch news feeds to
  readers based on their personal preferences.


  This demonstration rules engine uses Scala.
  
    http://www.scala-lang.org/

  To run the demo, open a command-prompt (terminal) window and navigate 
  to the out sub-folder, containing the JAR files. 
  Enter one of the following commands. 
  The program will process rules, display progress messages and results, and then exit.
  
    java -jar NewsGogglesScala.jar
    
    java -jar NewsGogglesScala.jar -test

  For more information, open the NewsGogglesScala.html file from the doc sub-folder
  in any web browser.
