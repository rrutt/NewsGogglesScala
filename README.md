News Goggles - Rules Engine in Scala and Java

  "News Goggles" is the name of an imaginary web site focused on daily
  news feeds. A proof-of-concept rules engine uses Scala and Java integration
  to apply matchmaker rules. These rules dispatch news feeds to
  readers based on their personal preferences.

  This demonstration rules engine uses Scala.

  To run the demo, clone the GitHub repository to your local workstation. Open a command-prompt (terminal) window and navigate to the root folder of your cloned repository. Enter one of the following commands. (Reverse the slashes if using Linux or Mac.) The program will process rules, display progress messages and results, and then exit.

    java -jar out\NewsGogglesScala.jar
  
    java -jar out\NewsGogglesScala.jar -test
